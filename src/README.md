## Why have I used Lisp?

The LISP programming language was devised as the programming language for Artificial Intelligence research. Nowadays, the functional programming is getting pretty popular, being adopted by the mainstream programming languages such as Java, C++ or Python (actually, Python supports all of Lisp's essential features except Macros). So, why not functional programming? You will learn a new programming paradigm, protoype fast, write short and concise code, and along the way, become a better programmer in languages you already know.

### Is someone else out there using Lisp? 
Peter Norvig, Research director at Google and one of the most famous Lisp lovers, provides Lisp code for his famous book Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/lisp/doc/overview.html and wrote a book about Artificial Intelligence using Common Lisp case studies: http://norvig.com/paip.html. Is it enough?

## Compilation

This repository provides the necessary source code and benchmarks to carry out the research corresponding to the PhD titled: "New Techniques and Algorithms for Multiobjective and Lexicographic Goal-Based Shortest Path Problems" defended on the University of Málaga in July, 2015. The code is implemented in ANSI Common Lisp and developed under Lispworks, a commercial implementation of Common Lisp. The code compilation has been tested on LispWorks 6 under Ubuntu 15.04 and Windows 7. Since no specific Lispworks classes were used, the source code "should" also be able to be compiled under other open source Common Lisp dialects. Please refer to the wiki section to see more detailed information about how to compile the source code in Lispworks and run the benchmarks.

_Note:_ In Ubuntu you might need to install libgtk2.0-0:i386, because Lispworks is not 64bit compilant and needs i386 version of gtk2 libraries.

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-0:i386 </code></pre>

## Contributing

Contributions are always encouraged! Some interesting things I have in mind:

- Bring the multiobjective algorithms to open source route planning applications like OSRM, GraphHopper or Valhalla.
- Port this code to another Lisp dialect or programming language.
 
If you like it, give it a Star ;).
