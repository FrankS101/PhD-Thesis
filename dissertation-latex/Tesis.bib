  Abstract                 = {Since Markowitz (1952) formulated the portfolio selection problem, many researchers have developed models aggregating simultaneously several conflicting attributes such as: the return on investment, risk and liquidity. The portfolio manager generally seeks the best combination of stocks/assets that meets his/her investment objectives. The Goal Programming (GP) model is widely applied to finance and portfolio management. The aim of this paper is to present the different variants of the GP model that have been applied to the financial portfolio selection problem from the 1970s to nowadays.},

  Abstract                 = {Goal programming as a well known technique has been widely used for solving multi objective decision making problems. However, in some practical cases, there may exist situations where the decision maker is interested in setting multi aspiration levels for objectives that may not be expressed in a precise manner. In this paper, a novel formulation of fuzzy multi-choice goal programming (FMCGP) is presented. The proposed approach not only improves the applicability of goal programming in real world situations but also provides useful insight about the solution of a new class of problems. To illustrate and clarify the proposed approach, a numerical example is presented.},

  Abstract                 = {The A * algorithm is the de facto standard used for pathfinding search. IDA * is a space-efficient version of A*, but it suffers from cycles in the search space (the price for using no storage), repeated visits to states (the overhead of iterative deepening), and a simplistic leftto-right traversal of the search tree. In this paper, the Fringe Search algorithm is introduced, a new algorithm inspired by the problem of eliminating the inefficiencies with IDA*. At one extreme, the Fringe Search algorithm expands frontier nodes in the exact same order as IDA*. At the other extreme, it can be made to expand them in the exact same order as A*. Experimental results show that Fringe Search runs roughly 10-40\% faster than highly-optimized A * in our application domain of pathfinding on a grid. 1},

  Abstract                 = {Monitoring flows on networks is a research area for which a number of applications are waiting for models and algorithms to face new problems emerging with a very high pace. In this paper we analyze a particular optimization problem, namely the Dominating Paths Problem (DPP), that has application in this field especially for urban transportation networks. Given an undirected graph G=(V,E) and a subset B‚äÜV of bound vertices, we look for a set of vertices M of minimum size such that each element of M is the origin of one or more paths, and, the set of all these paths dominates B. For this NP-hard problem, we present an approximation algorithm and new heuristic procedures extensively evaluated on a set of test instances. We defined two different sets of benchmarks: grid graphs and random graphs. Moreover, we included two test cases taken from real traffic networks. Computational results, discussed in the paper, give insights both on problem and on algorithms‚Äô performance.},

  Abstract                 = {The aim of the present paper is to provide a methodology for finding a set of alternative paths between an origin and a destination site on which routing one or a set of dangerous goods. Finding a set of paths allows one to equally distribute the total risk among the population exposed. The concept of equity of risk is here related to the concept of determining spatially dissimilar paths. We divide our approach into two phases. In the first phase we find a set of Pareto-Optimal paths between an origin and a destination, by implementing a multicriteria shortest path algorithm. In the second one, for each path previously found, and by using a geographical information system, we construct a Buffer Zone approximating the impact area of a material being released after an accident. Based on these Buffer Zones, a dissimilarity index between every pair of paths can be derived in order to find the most spatially different routes. We then compare our method with an iterative penalty method and discuss computational results based both on a real application and on test problems.},

  Abstract                 = {We explore a method for computing admissible heuristic evaluation functions for search problems. It utilizes pattern databases (Culberson \& Schae er, 1998), which are precomputed tables of the exact cost of solving various subproblems of an existing problem. Unlike standard pattern database heuristics, however, we partition our problems into disjoint subproblems, so that the costs of solving the di erent subproblems can be added together without overestimating the cost of solving the original problem. Previously (Korf \& Felner, 2002) we showed how to statically partition the sliding-tile puzzles into disjoint groups of tiles to compute an admissible heuristic, using the same partition for each state and problem instance. Here we extend the method and show that it applies to other domains as well. We also present another method for additive heuristics which we call dynamically partitioned pattern databases. Here we partition the problem into disjoint subproblems for each state of the search dynamically. We discuss the pros and cons of each of these methods and apply both methods to three di erent problem domains: the sliding-tile puzzles, the 4-peg Towers of Hanoi problem, and nding an optimal vertex cover of a graph. We nd that in some problem domains, static partitioning is most e ective, while in others dynamic partitioning is a better choice. In each of these problem domains, either statically partitioned or dynamically partitioned pattern database heuristics are the best known heuristics for the problem.},

  Abstract                 = {A pattern database (PDB) is a heuristic function implemented as a lookup table that stores the lengths of optimal solutions for subproblem instances. Standard PDBs have a distinct entry in the table for each subproblem instance. In this paper we investigate compressing PDBs by merging several entries into one, thereby allowing the use of PDBs that exceed available memory in their uncompressed form. We introduce a number of methods for determining which entries to merge and discuss their relative merits. These vary from domainindependent approaches that allow any set of entries in the PDB to be merged, to more intelligent methods that take into account the structure of the problem. The choice of the best compression method is based on domain-dependent attributes. We present experimental results on a number of combinatorial problems, including the four-peg Towers of Hanoi problem, the sliding-tile puzzles, and the Top-Spin puzzle. For the Towers of Hanoi, we show that the search time can be reduced by up to three orders of magnitude by using compressed PDBs compared to uncompressed PDBs of the same size. More modest improvements were observed for the other domains.},

In KBFS, each iteration simultaneously expands the K best nodes from the open-list (rather than just the best as in BFS). We claim that KBFS outperforms BFS in domains where the heuristic function has large errors in estimation of the real distance to the goal state or does not predict dead-ends in the search tree. We present empirical results that confirm this claim and show that KBFS outperforms BFS by a factor of 15 on random trees with dead-ends, and by a factor of 2 and 7 on the Fifteen and Twenty-Four tile puzzles, respectively. KBFS also finds better solutions than BFS and hill-climbing for the number partitioning problem. KBFS is only appropriate for finding approximate solutions with inadmissible heuristic functions.},

  Abstract                 = {We describe how to convert the heuristic search algorithm A * into an anytime algorithm that finds a sequence of improved solutions and eventually converges to an optimal solution. The approach we adopt uses weighted heuristic search to find an approximate solution quickly, and then continues the weighted search to find improved solutions as well as to improve a bound on the suboptimality of the current solution. When the time available to solve a search problem is limited or uncertain, this creates an anytime heuristic search algorithm that allows a flexible tradeoff between search time and solution quality. We analyze the properties of the resulting Anytime A * algorithm, and consider its performance in three domains; sliding-tile puzzles, STRIPS planning, and multiple sequence alignment. To illustrate the generality of this approach, we also describe how to transform the memoryefficient search algorithm Recursive Best-First Search (RBFS) into an anytime algorithm. 1.},

  Abstract                 = {Pathfinding systems that operate on regular grids are common in the AI literature and often used in real-time video games. Typical speed-up enhancements include reducing the size of the search space using abstraction, and building more informed heuristics. Though effective each of these strategies has shortcomings. For example, pathfinding with abstraction usually involves trading away optimality for speed. Meanwhile, improving on the accuracy of the well known Manhattan heuristic usually requires significant extra memor We present a different kind of speedup technique based on the idea of identifying and eliminating symmetric path segments in 4-connected grid maps (which allow straight but not diagonal movement). Our method identifies rectangular rooms with no obstacles and prunes all interior nodes, leaving only a boundary perimeter. This process eliminates many symmetric path segments and results in grid maps which are often much smaller and consequently much faster to search than the original. We evaluate our technique on a range of different grid maps including a well known set from the popular video game Baldur's Gate II. On our test data, A* can run up to 3.5 times faster on average. We achieve this without using any significant extra memory or sacrificing solution optimality.},

Moreover, there is no adequate conceptual framework within which the various ad hoc search strategies proposed to date can be compared. This paper describes how heuristic information from the problem domain can be incorporated into a formal mathematical theory of graph searching and demonstrates an optimality property of a class of search strategies.},

  Abstract                 = {Shortest path problem where the costs have vague values is one of the most studied problems in fuzzy sets and systems area. However, due to its high computational complexity, previously published algorithms present peculiarities and problems that need to be addressed (e.g. they find costs without an existing path, they determine a fuzzy solution set but do not give any guidelines to help the decision-maker choose the best path, they can only be applied in graphs with fuzzy non-negative parameters, etc.). In this paper, one proposes an iterative algorithm that assumes a generic ranking index for comparing the fuzzy numbers involved in the problem, in such a way that each time in which the decision-maker wants to solve a concrete problem (s)he can choose (or propose) the ranking index that best suits that problem. This algorithm, that solves the above remarked drawbacks, is based on the Ford‚ÄìMoore‚ÄìBellman algorithm for classical graphs, and in concrete it can be applied in graphs with negative parameters and it can detect whether there are negative circuits. For the sake of illustrating the performance of the algorithm in the paper, it has been here developed using only certain order relations, but it is not restricted at all to use these comparison relations exclusively. The proposed algorithm is easy of understanding as the theoretical base of a decision support system oriented to solving this kind of problems.},

Since useful theoretical comparisons are difficult to achieve, it usually takes some time until a newly developed search algorithm is appropriately compared to its competitors. At least in addition to theoretical comparisons, therefore, well-designed experiments should be performed. Unfortunately, however, we still observe severe problems in the current way of how empirical comparisons of heuristic search algorithms are reported in the literature. Based on our own experience with developing search algorithms and comparing them through experiments in real domains, we recommend specific guidelines for experimental comparisons. 1 Introduction Many heuristic search algorithms have been developed and still are under development.

  Abstract                 = {Most of the work on search in artificial intelligence (AI) deals with one search direction only-mostly forward search-although it is known that a structural asymmetry of the search graph causes differences in the efficiency of searching in the forward or the backward direction, respectively. In the case of symmetrical graph structure, however, current theory would not predict such differences in efficiency. In several classes of job sequencing problems, we observed a phenomenon of asymmetry in search that relates to the distribution of the are costs in the search graph. This phenomenon can be utilized for improving the search efficiency by a new algorithm that automatically selects the search direction. We demonstrate fur a class of job sequencing problems that, through the utilization of this phenomenon, much more difficult problems can be solved-according to our best knowledge-than by the best published approach, and on the same problems, the running time is much reduced.

The code "NETGEN" can generate capacitated and uncapacitated transportation and minimum cost flow network problems, and assignment problems. In addition to generating structurally different classes of network problems the code permits the user to vary structural characteristics within a class. Problems benchmarked on several codes currently available are provided in this paper since NETGEN will also allow other researchers to generate identical problems. In particular, the latter part of the paper contains the solution time and objective function value of 40 assignment, transportation, and network problems varying in size from 200 nodes to 8,000 nodes and from 1,300 arcs to 35,000 arcs.},

  Abstract                 = {. In the past several years, significant progress has been made in finding optimal solutions to combinatorial problems. In particular, random instances of both Rubik‚Äôs Cube, with over 10 19 states, andthe 5√ó5 sliding-tile puzzle, with almost 10 25 states, have been solvedoptimally. This progress is not the result of better search algorithms, but more effective heuristic evaluation functions. In addition, we have learned how to accurately predict the running time of admissible heuristic search algorithms, as a function of the solution depth and the heuristic evaluation function. One corollary of this analysis is that an admissible heuristic function reduces the effective depth of search, rather than the effective branching factor. 1},

  Abstract                 = {We have found the first optimal solutions to random instances of Rubik's Cube. The median optimal solution length appears to be 18 moves. The algorithm used is iterative-deepening-A* (IDA*), with a lowerbound heuristic function based on large memory-based lookup tables, or "pattern databases" (Culberson and Schaeffer 1996). These tables store the exact number of moves required to solve various subgoals of the problem, in this case subsets of the individual movable cubies. We characterize the effectiveness of an admissible heuristic function by its expected value, and hypothesize that the overall performance of the program obeys a relation in which the product of the time and space used equals the size of the state space. Thus, the speed of the program increases linearly with the amount of memory available. As computer memories become larger and cheaper, we believe that this approach will become increasingly cost-effective. Introduction 1 Rubik's Cube, invented in the late 1970s by Ern...},

In AI problems, the sequence of steps required for solution of a problem are not known a priori, but often must be determined by a systematic trial-and-error exploration of alternatives. The problems that have been addressed by AI search algorithms fall into three general classes: single-agent pathfinding problems, two-player games, and constraint-satisfaction problems. Classic examples in the AI literature of pathfinding problems are the sliding-tile puzzles, including the 3 $\backslash$Theta 3 Eight Puzzle (see Fig. 1) and its larger relatives the 4 $\backslash$Theta 4 Fifteen Puzzle, and 5 $\backslash$Theta 5 Twenty-Four Puzzle. The Eight Puzzle consists of a 3 $\backslash$Theta 3 square frame containing eight numbered square tiles, and an empty position called the blank. The legal operators are to slide any tile that is h},

Our new contribution to this problem is a more powerful admissible heuristic function. We present a general theory for the automatic discovery of such heuristics, which is based on considering multiple subgoals simultaneously. In addition, we apply a technique for pruning duplicate nodes in depth-first search using a finite-state machine. Finally, we observe that as heuristic search problems are scaled up, more powerful heuristic functions become both necessary and cost-effective.

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we present a new algorithm for solving the multi-objective shortest path problem (MSPP) which consists of finding all the non-dominated paths between two nodes s and t (ND s-t paths), on a network where a multiple criteria function is defined over the set of arcs. The main feature of the algorithm is that, contrarily to the previous most efficient approaches for the MSPP, not all of the ND sub-paths on the network need to be found. Additionally, the algorithm fully exploits the fact that ND s-t paths are generated at a very early stage of the ranking procedure. The computational experience reported in the paper shows that, for large size general type networks, the new algorithm clearly outperforms the labeling approach},

  Abstract                 = {Multiobjective shortest path problems are computationally harder than single objective ones. In partic- ular, execution time is an important limiting factor in exact multiobjective search algorithms. This paper explores the possibility of improving search performance in those cases where the interesting portion of the Pareto front can be initially bounded. We introduce a new exact label-setting algorithm that returns the subset of Pareto optimal paths that satisfy a set of lexicographic goals, or the subset that minimizes deviation from goals if these cannot be fully satisfied. Formal proofs on the correctness of the algorithm are provided. We also show that the algorithm always explores a subset of the labels explored by a full Pareto search. The algorithm is evaluated over a set of problems with three objectives, showing a perfor- mance improvement of up to several orders of magnitude as goals become more restrictive.},

The new algorithm is based on a critical review of the basic search reduction operations in previous algorithms like BS* or Switch-A*. The general guideline is to let search fronts meet as close to midground as possible. In a first phase, search is discontinued at nodes as soon as the opposite frontier is met, terminating when one of the fronts runs out of open nodes. In a second phase, unidirectional search is conducted from the discontinued nodes until an optimal solution can be guaranteed. The new algorithm is tested on random instances of the 15-puzzle and on path-finding problems. A significant improvement in efficiency is observed when compared with other bidirectional algorithms.},

  Abstract                 = {This article presents interval goal programming (IGP) approach for solving linear multiobjective fuzzy goal programming problem with interval weights. In the proposed approach, interval weights for achievement of fuzzy goals to their aspired levels on the basis of their relative importance are considered in an uncertain environment. In the model formulation of the problem, the membership functions for each of the fuzzy goals are defined first. Then, the membership functions are transformed into membership goals by assigning the highest membership value (unity) and introducing under-and over-deviational variables to each of them. In the solution process, the interval weights (derived from pairwise interval judgment matrix) associated with the unwanted deviational variables is introduced in the goal achievement function for minimizing them to reach the aspired goal levels of the problem. To illustrate the proposed approach, a numerical example is solved.},

  Abstract                 = {Manpower scheduling is an intricate problem in production and service environments with the purpose of generating fair schedules that consider employers‚Äô objectives and employees‚Äô preferences as much as possible. However, sometimes, vagueness of information related to employers‚Äô objectives and employees‚Äô preferences leads to the fuzzy nature of the problem. This paper presents a multi-objective manpower scheduling model regarding the lack of clarity on the target values of employers‚Äô objectives and employees‚Äô preferences. Hence, a fuzzy goal programming model is developed for the presented model. Afterwards, two fuzzy solution approaches are used to convert the fuzzy goal programming model to two single-objective models. Finally, the results obtained by both single-objective models are compared with each other to select the solution that has the greatest degree of the satisfaction level of employers‚Äô objectives and employees‚Äô preferences.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper proposes a Fuzzy Goal Programming model (FGP) for a real aggregate production-planning problem. To do so, an application was made in a Brazilian Sugar and Ethanol Milling Company. The FGP Model depicts the comprehensive production process of sugar, ethanol, molasses and derivatives, and considers the uncertainties involved in ethanol and sugar production. Decision-makings, related to the agricultural and logistics phases, were considered on a weekly-basis planning horizon to include the whole harvesting season and the periods between harvests. The research has provided interesting results about decisions in the agricultural stages of cutting, loading and transportation to sugarcane suppliers and, especially, in milling decisions, whose choice of production process includes storage and logistics distribution.},

Modelling techniques such as detection and restoration of pareto efficiency, normalisation, redundancy checking, and non-standard utility function modelling are overviewed. The connection between GP and other multi-objective-programming techniques as well as a utility interpretation of GP are examined. The rationality of ranking Multi-Criteria Decision Making techniques, and of placing GP in such a ranking, is discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Automatic web services composition has recently received considerable attention from researchers in different fields. In this paper we propose a model based on web service dependency graph and a bidirectional heuristic search algorithm to find composite web services. The proposed algorithm is based on a new domain independent heuristic. Experiments on different types of dependency graphs of varying sizes and number of web services show promising results for the service composition model when compared to state-of-the-art search algorithms. The proposed dependency graph based composition model is, however, not limited to traditional web services but it can be extended to more general frameworks of collective systems where a global intelligent behavior emerges by a plurality of agents which interact composing different actions, services, or resources.},
